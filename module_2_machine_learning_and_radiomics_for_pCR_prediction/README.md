## Large segmentation model for Multi-Parametric MRI 
- This module is built upon the research presented in the paper titled "[Segment anything in medical images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44824-z)". We would like to sincerely thank the authors and contributors of the MedSAM project for their exceptional work in developing this innovative medical image segmentation model. Their dedication and research have significantly advanced the field, and their code has played a crucial role in the success and functionality of our project.
- The implemented code is based on GitHub at [bowang-lab/MedSAM](https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM).
- We have adapted and expanded upon it to meet the specific requirements of our implementation, and the extension code is in the folder - "rectal_cancer_expansion".
- Collected MRI images from the four examined modalities underwent comprehensive pre-processing steps, including outlier exclusion (0.5th and 99.5th percentiles), data clipping, normalization, and zero value preservation. Subsequently, all pre-processed images were uniformly resized to 1024Ã—1024 pixels. We proposed a novel two-stage hybrid model that integrates a large segmentation model with the XGBoost algorithm.  The segmentation module was constructed using four-channel MedSAM networks. Each channel architecture included an image encoder, an image embedding module, a prompt encoder, and a mask decoder. Given the varying shapes and segmentation challenges of rectal cancer lesions, bounding box prompts were primarily utilized. Thus, both pre-nCRT and post-nCRT MRI images were directly input into MedSAM to generate corresponding segmentation results: Seg1, Seg2, Seg3, Seg4.

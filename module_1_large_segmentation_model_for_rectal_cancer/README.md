## Large segmentation model for MRI imaging
- This module is built upon the research presented in the paper titled "[A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04868.pdf)". We would like to sincerely thank the authors of MedSAM for their foundamental work on the model, which has greatly contributed to this project.
- The implemented code is based on GitHub at [DebeshJha/2020-CBMS-DoubleU-Net](https://github.com/DebeshJha/2020-CBMS-DoubleU-Net).
- We have adapted and expanded upon it to meet the specific requirements of our implementation, and the extension code is in the fold - "".
